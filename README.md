! Very early stage of the project, WIP disclaimer !

# PSA
## Please support indie game developers if you can afford to.

# Why?
> Because I don't like steam's monopoly but I like their ui.

# What's that?
Unchained launcher is a steam big picture ripoff that would allow steamdeck/linux gamers for playing and downloading non-steam games seamlessly without any hassle.

# How do i run it?
Clone the repo, then install dependencies in requirements.txt, proceed with running build.py script that should pop out a full binary for your system in dist/... 

# Supported systems?
Mainly linux support as I personally do not care about supporting Windows.

# How does it work?
It scans the games in your ~/Games/data folder, then creates other folders like ~/Games/metadata for storing offline metadata such as artwork for games or ~/Games/saves for saving saves. In future ~/Games/tools will contain any useful tools for non-steam gaming (maybe gbe). 

# Goal.
My goal with this project is to create a seamless gui for gaming that will allow users to download games, share them, play them (alone or together), download apps, run them, maybe manage savefiles and achievements, track playtime. Of course everything would need to be decentralized... I thought of not so creative idea about utilizing the "friends" (peers) to share game files (main focus) and save files (maybe some barter like I safely keep your precious save files and you keep my precious save files, but of course polyamourous...), also it would be fun to see what your friends are playing at the time and maybe download their game and join them...
